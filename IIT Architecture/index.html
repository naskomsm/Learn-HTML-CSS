                    <p>
                        SoftUni is one of the largest and most respected educational institutions, creating professionals in the fields of software engineering, digital marketing and design. Today SoftUni works directly with more than 70 IT companies and has an active community
                        of 150 000 students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Founded in 2013, with its unique concept and innovative educational methodology, SoftUni is rapidly becoming a market leader and today organizes hundreds of training programs, free courses and webinars, events and other educational initiatives that provide
                        quality education to thousands of young people in the field of IT and digital technologies.

                    <p>
                        With its foundation in 2013, SoftUni starts its first and most successful project - the "Software University" - a unique educational initiative which creates high-quality software engineers from scratch, achieving incredible success rate - 97% of all
                        graduates successfully start their career as software engineers.
                    </p>

                        "Software University" is a project of SoftUni and is not among the state recognized universities, because the purpose of "Software University" is to be their alternative, providing their students with everything they need to start their career!
